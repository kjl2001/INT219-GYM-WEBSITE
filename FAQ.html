            <p>This is a wonderful well equipped gym. Air conditioned, good change rooms with showers. Lots of new equipment to let you workout any way you want to. The staff were great and let us transfer our 1 week membership after we ended up at a different gym that was also called Elite Gym but not the one that had all the great reviews on Tripadvisor. Make sure you go to the one in Chaweng opposite the lake and next door to McDonalds. It's called Elite Gym 'Exclusive'</p></div>

      <p>Been to Elite gym every Time I Travel to Samui. 3 Times/year.
Best equipment. Fresch. Friendly and staff Who helps you. Air con gym. Day pass 400bht. A little bit expensive. The other gym they've got near Tesco Lotus is cheaper. Differences are that the second gym dont have air cons. Only fan.
Equipment are top!!!This gym is very modern and big with splendid equipment. The athmosphere is serious and stimulating, many tourists also. The spinning bikes are new, the lessons are varied and heavy enough. This gym is open all day also in the weekends. Service is quick and accurate. Price for tourist card is cheap.This gym has potential with decent equipment and good location. What makes it a 1 star or 2 star gym is that it is filthy dirty! Machines are sticky because they seem to not have been cleaned, windows are grey from dirt.This gym is very modern and big with splendid equipment.Price for tourist card is cheap.</p>

      <p>This gym has potential with decent equipment and good location. What makes it a 1 star or 2 star gym is that it is filthy dirty! Machines are sticky because they seem to not have been cleaned, windows are grey from dirt. What is bad, but I guess it’s normal in Thailand they have a good set of rules: No outside shoes, always use a towel, put your weights back or pay a fine of 100 baht and have to leave gym. The bad is that they don’t enforce this!! All these wannabe disco-pumpers here leave their plates on the machines as these sissies are too weak to put back 20lbs plates and don’t use towels and come with dirty outside shoes. No wonder this gym os dirty. Unfortunately I already paid for the monthly pass and can’t get back my money. My advice, inspect the gym properly or get a day pass first for 400baht.
If management would clean it it would be a 4 star!
Oh and also no credit cards accepted here!</p>

      <p>When we first approached the gym everything seemed as promised in the reviews: a set of clear rules, even mentioning that if members who don’t obey to put back the equipment will be fined or even removed from the gym. But writing rules and enforcing them is a whole different story. Every equipment I used I had to remove weights, as I don’t lift as much as a dude (myself being a woman). This was very annoying. Then half of the equipment I couldn’t adjust in height (seat etc.) as the nobs were broken or jammed in some kind of way. Great thanks for that... Handles of equipment was either slipping off, sticky or broken... new equipment? Well maintained?! Sure... price - I would set a huge tick on that one... I’ve been to various gyms all over Thailand, clearly this one needs some improvements. It could be a good if not even a great gym if it lives up to its potential - so far it has not.Price for tourist card is cheap.</p>
