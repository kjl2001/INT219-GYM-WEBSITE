was inspired by my own love of exercise and delight in motivating others to achieve their training goals. I registered the business in September 2007 on completion of a Certificate III in fitness and Certificate IV in personal training.

        <br>
            However my experience in health and fitness extends beyond recent study to a lifetime of sport and training, years of which was devoted to triathlon and ultra-distance racing. I have experienced the immense personal pride and satisfaction that comes from finishing multiple ironman triathlon races and know that all-round enrichment comes from achieving goals and feeling great about your body image.
