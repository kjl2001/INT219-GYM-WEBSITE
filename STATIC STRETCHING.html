        <p>As physical therapists we are frequently asked about stretching exercises. Static stretching exercises are those stretches that you are told to hold for so many seconds and do so many times a day. When you think of stretching, it is usually this type of stretching that immediately comes to mind.

To perform this type of stretching exercise one must elongate the muscles as tolerated and that position is then held for a particular length of time. The time a stretch is held is determined by your age, pre existing conditions, activity level, and any injuries. For more information on how long to hold a static stretch click here.

In most cases it is a safe way to elongate soft tissues for those just beginning an exercise program and sedentary individuals.</p>

          <h3 class="bucket-title">Should You Stretch Before Exercise?</h3>
          <p>
Not necessarily. It's not proven to help prevent injury, curb muscle soreness after exercise, or improve your performance.<br>

Static stretching before exercise can weaken performance, such as sprint speed, in studies. The most likely reason is that holding the stretch tires out your muscles.<br>

You should warm up by doing dynamic stretches, which are like your workout but at a lower intensity. A good warm-up before a run could be a brisk walk, walking lunges, leg swings, high steps, or "butt kicks" .<br>

Start slowly, and gradually ramp up the intensity.

This is a great time to stretch.<br>

"Everyone is more flexible after exercise, because you've increased the circulation to those muscles and joints and you've been moving them," Millar says.<br>

If you do static stretches, you'll get the most benefit from them now.<br>Staying flexible as you age is a good idea. It helps you move better.<br>

"After you go for a run or weight-train, you walk around a little to cool down. Then you do some stretching. It's a nice way to end a workout," Bracko says.</p>

          <h3 class="bucket-title">Can You Stretch Anytime?</h3>
          <p>

Yes. It is not a must that you stretch before or after your regular workout. It is simply important that you stretch sometime.<br>

This can be when you wake up, before bed, or during breaks at work.<br>f your posture or activities are a problem, make it a habit to stretch those muscles regularly. If you have back pain from sitting at a desk all day, stretches that reverse that posture could help.<br>

"Stretching or flexibility should be a part of a regular program," Millar says.

      <h2 class="content-title">A well-rounded static-stretching program provides the following benefits:</h2>
      <p>
General consensus now is that pre-participation static stretching is not beneficial for optimum performance. Your warm up is best to consist of active exercises to increase circulation with sport specific movements. This type of activity causes increased temperature in the muscles used which improves elasticity and therefore flexibility. Depending on your sport, specific dynamic or ballistic stretching may be more appropriate.<br>

After a workout is the best time to perform static stretches. Muscles are warm, ligaments and joints are more elastic, but if you suffer from muscular imbalances or are interested in maintaining or increasing your flexibility, static stretches should be done daily..<br>An increase in stretch tolerance after a static stretch may mask pain that would normally result in muscle guarding during an injurious activity.<br>

The American Heart Association recommends strength training at least twice per week.<br>

Strengthening your muscles gives you the ability to perform everyday activities and helps protect your body from injury. Stronger muscles also lead to a boost in your metabolic rate, which means you’ll burn more calories even when your body is at rest.<br>
Better quality of life.<p>

      <h2 class="content-title">Static Stretching Exercise benifits!!</h2>
      <p>Static stretching has shown, through research, to improve flexibility and joint range of motion<br>
This mode of stretching prevents the soft tissues from absorbing high amounts of energy over a short period of time as does ballistic stretching.<br>
This slow form of stretching will not facilitate a strong relfex response and so helps in relaxation.<br>
This form of stretching can alleviate muscle soreness.<br>
Stretching in a static manner is thought to be the safest way to stretch and therefore is most appropriate for a large percentage of the population.<br>
Stretching statically can be done individually, unlike PNF or assisted stretching and no special knowledge or handling is required.</p>

      <h2 class="content-title">What if I’m recovering from a cardiac event or stroke?</h2>
      <p>Static stretches were emphasized years ago amongst gymnasts, track and field participants, and skaters. In these particular sports one requires a great deal of flexibility to perform the tasks of the sport. In sports such as hockey (goalies excluded), rugby, or football, this extreme flexibility is not necessary. Every sport has a certain set of skills that requires a given flexibility. Exceeding this flexibility is no guarantee of injury prevention; however, if one doesn't have the adequate flexibility necessary to perform the sport, they are definitely prone to injury.<br>
Certain activities don't benefit from increased flexibility.<br>
Stretching doesn't effect muscle elasticity during eccentric activity which is when most injuries occur.<br>
Stretching may result in microtrauma to the muscle predisposing it to injury.<br>
