      <h3 class="title"> Mylene Biddle Visualized Her Way to a Better Body</h3>
      <p>
Weight before: 165 lb
Weight now: 130 lb
Age: 28
Height: 5'2"
Location: Crestview, FL
Occupation: Software engineer
Tip for newbies: "Set your mind to it and go!"

Mylene dropped 35 pounds in under two years and picturing success played a big part in her transformation. "If I literally feel like I can't do one more rep of a difficult exercise, I think of pro bodybuilder Ronnie Coleman's saying, 'Ain't nothing but a peanut!' and envision the weight as a tiny peanut," she laughs. "And then I lift it."

When she wasn't envisioning healthy fats on the ends of her barbell, she visualized the buff body parts she was working towards. "I'd see a nice biceps bulge, some well-defined lats and rock-hard glutes during my workouts," she says. With her goals in front of her, Mylene was able to push harder and tune in to her individual muscles.

"Knowing I am a strong woman keeps me motivated," she says. If she can envision it, she says, it ain't nothing but a peanut.

          <h4>Wendy Mills Became Fit by 50</h4>
          <p>
Weight before: 225 lbs
Weight now: 124 lbs
Age: 50
Height: 5' 5"
Location: Aurora, Ontario
Occupation: Chartered Accountant
Proudest moment: "When I started to see muscle definition!"

When she was 46 years old, Wendy Mills set a goal: to be her absolute fittest by her 50th birthday. "I knew I would have to lose about 100 pounds!" she says. "So I started setting smaller goals, like giving up fast food or going for a walk." Taking it slowly, she lost the first 55 pounds.

At 170 pounds, the scale became stuck. She signed up with a personal trainer and started weigh training. "I was terrified," she admits. But once she started, Wendy found that her mission changed. No longer focusing on losing weight by the time she turned 50, she transformed her mindset: "My goals became strength-related," explains Wendy, who now includes home training sessions in her routine. Equipped with weights, a bench, resistance bands and medicine balls, Wendy replicates gym exercises. And when it comes to getting results, home reps count as much as gym reps.

Weighing in at 124 pounds, Wendy reached her goal two years early. She turned 50 this year and happily reported that she has maintained her fit lifestyle. "I am now aiming for fit at 60!" she says. "I have not lost my motivation."</p>

          <h4>Paula Hannah Ditched her Excuses</h4>
          <p> 
Weight before: 227 lbs
Weight now: 150 lbs
Age: 49
Height: 5'9.5"
Location: Cincinnati, OH
Occupation: Corporate paralegal
Eat-clean breakfast: Steel-cut oatmeal with cinnamon, vanilla and egg whites

Paula Hannah used to come up with any and every excuse to get out of a workout. "The most ridiculous one was that I didn't want to mess up my hair!" she says. But at 227 pounds and with severe asthma, Paula knew the excuses had to stop.

Paula joined the fitness center at work, a gym that's a 20-minute walk from home, and a smaller gym on her bus route. While having to rely on public transit would have stopped her before, this time she was determined to succeed. "I made a vow to myself to do whatever it takes," she says. "If I travelled by bus to get to the gym, then I was going to do the work!"

She knew she'd reached a milestone when she lasted an entire spin class. "Friends texted me, one by one, to say they weren't coming. My instinct was to leave - I don't like doing things by myself." Instead, Paula stayed, planning to duck out early. "When the instructor yelled, '15 minutes left,' I started to cry. I did it!"</p>

          <h4>Lynn Lester-Howland Went From 'Skinny Fat' to Muscle Mom</h4>
          <p>
Weight before and now: 126 lb
Age: 37
Height: 5'7"
Location: Dubuque, IA
Occupation: Optometrist
Words of Wisdom: "If you don't make an ugly face, you are not lifting heavy enough."

Lynn's breast cancer diagnosis back in 2009 propelled her towards fitness and taught her to get tough. "I made the decision that I was in control," she says. Despite feeling lost in the weights section at first, Lynn cut back on endless cardio and got serious about building muscle. She knew having a lean, toned body was one of the two things she could count on to make her feel stronger.

The second thing? Her kids. She got her son and daughter on board, teaching them about the benefits of eating clean and exercising. "I have to laugh now because my children will ask me if they can come to the gym and tell me to feel their muscles as they flex their biceps," she says.

Cancer free and more confident than ever, Lynn is putting her muscle into shaping up her future with her family. No longer skinny fat but fit, she welcomes new challenges with strength and focus. "I feel like I own the gym now," she says.

          <h4>Denise Fields Learned to Love Living Healthy</h4>
          <p>
Weight before: 200 lb
Weight now: 130 lb
Age: 31
Height: 5'3"
Location: Kansas City, Missouri
Occupation: Attorney
Favorite Move: Bicep curls

When size 14 started to feel too tight, a 200-pound Denise promised to purge the pudge and set out to lose 70 pounds.

Step one? Denise got to work in the kitchen. She swapped her morning mocha for a clean breakfast, replaced regular restaurant fair with six smaller meals a day, and experimented with spices, marinades and healthy swaps. "Most surprising to me was that I could cook healthy foods that I actually loved more than the bad-for-me foods," she says.

Step two? She ditched the excuses - including a busy day. "We all make time for the things that are important to us," says Denise, who squeezed in five cardio and three strength-training sessions a week and discovered a calorie-burner she truly loved: running. "Once you find an activity that you love to do, it won't seem like exercising as much."

After dropping 50 pounds in less than a year, she hit a wall. Denise tightened up her diet, upped her water intake, started focusing on just two muscle groups per strength-training session and introduced Tabata, high-intensity interval training. "I just told myself that to quit or slack off at this stage is like stopping just when you see the finish line."</p>

      <p class="quote">Change It Up, Like Denise
Denise keeps her cardio exciting by switching things up every few weeks. A few tips:

Change up your course: Look online for new routes.
Change up your terrain: Donâ€™t shy away from hills.
Change up your pace: Try sprint intervals on the track.
Change up your finish line: Sign up for a 5k or half-marathon for added training incentive. </p>

      <p class="quote">Lynn's Tips
Do weights before cardio so you're not depleting your energy before you start lifting.
Go heavy. "If I can do more than seven reps, I bump the weight up."
Perform intervals instead of steady-state cardio. "I go as hard as I can, then recover and repeat. If I get to 20 minutes, it's a rare day!"
Immediately after your workout, consume a whey isolate protein shake and a fast-acting carb.
Eat! "If you don't eat enough, you won't build muscle."</p>
      <p class="author">- Lynn</p>
      <p class="quote">Keep Track Like Paula
Paula says that writing down her fitness accomplishments helped. "I record the smallest victories, like drinking a gallon of water, lifting a heavier weight or getting to bed on time". At the end of the month, she goes over her successes. "It reminds me to stay on the right track!"</p>
