        <p>Endurance training is the act of exercising to increase endurance. The term endurance training generally refers to training the aerobic system as opposed to the anaerobic system. The need for endurance in sports is often predicated as the need of cardiovascular and simple muscular endurance, but the issue of endurance is far more complex. Endurance can be divided into two categories including: general endurance and specific endurance. It can be shown that endurance in sport is closely tied to the execution of skill and technique. A well conditioned athlete can be defined as, the athlete who executes his or her technique consistently and effectively with the least effort.[1] Key for measuring endurance are heart rate, power in cycling and pace in running.</p>

      <h2 class="content-title">Endurance in sports</h2>
      <p>
Endurance training is essential for a variety of endurance sports. A notable example is distance running events (800 meters upwards to marathon and ultra-marathon) with the required degree of endurance training increasing with race distance. Two other popular examples are cycling (particularly road cycling) and competitive swimming. These three endurance sports are combined in the triathlon. Other sports for which extensive amounts of endurance training are required include rowing and cross country skiing. Athletes can also undergo endurance training when their sport may not necessarily be an endurance sport in the whole sense but may still demand some endurance. For instance aerobic endurance is necessary, in varying extents, in racket sports, football, rugby, martial arts, basketball and cricket. Endurance exercise tends to be popular with non-athletes for the purpose of increasing general fitness or burning more calories to increase weight loss potential.<p>

      <h2 class="content-title">Methods and training plans</h2>
      <p>
Systematic training is the key for good results. Common methods for training include periodization, intervals, hard easy, long slow distance, and in recent years high-intensity interval training.
<br>
The periodization method is very common and was accredited to Tudor Bompa[12] and consists of blocks of time, generally 4–12 weeks each<br>
Rob Leamaker and Ray Browning promote the S.E.R.I.O.U.S method. Consisting of; Speed Training and drills, Endurance/Easy distance, Race/pace training, Intervals, Overdistance/long, slow distance, Uphill intervals/vertical training, Strength/resistance training <br>
MAF Training is focused on building an aerobic base, eat well, reduce stress, improve brain function</p>

    <div class="twin">
      <h2 class="content-title">Devices to assess endurance fitness</h2>
      <p>
The heart rate monitor is one of the relatively easy methods to assess fitness in endurance athletes. By comparing heart rate over time fitness gains can be observed when the heart rate decreases for running.<br> In cycling the effect of wind on the cyclists speed is difficult to subtract out and so many cyclists now use power meters built into their bicycles. The power meter allows the athlete to actually measure power output over a set duration or course and allows direct comparison of fitness progression.<br> In the 2008 Olympics Michael Phelps was aided by repeated lactate threshold measurement. This allowed his coaches to fine tune his training program so that he could recover between swim events that were sometimes several minutes apart.</p>
